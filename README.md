# Signup and Authenticate with REACT

- make a form
- post it up
- get an authentication back

## Notes on What I Have Learned in this Workshop:

- Now have starting a new Vite project and starting a new github repo down!
- Read the directions carefully! I deleted the app.css file and then had to find it and put it back in!
- the handleSubmit function gets called just through {handleSubmit} and no need to do onSubmit={(e) => handleSubmit(e)}
- handleSubmit goes in the FORM and __not__ the button. 
- remember: state variables are declared __inside__ the main function.
